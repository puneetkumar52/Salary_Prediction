## üí∞ Salary Predictor AI Model
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict salaries based on various professional and demographic features. The project includes data generation, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using a Random Forest Regressor, and a web application for interactive predictions built with Streamlit.

## üåü Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a regression task. We predict an individual's salary using a synthetic dataset that simulates real-world HR data. The project emphasizes clear, modular code and provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions.

## ‚ú® Features
Synthetic Data Generation: A Python script to create a realistic dataset with over 1000 rows and 16 features, including YearsExperience, JobRole, EducationLevel, City, Gender, Industry, etc.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Script to handle duplicates, correct data types, and engineer new features like EmploymentDurationYears.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization scripts to understand data distributions, relationships between features, and correlations.

Machine Learning Model Training: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to build a robust predictive model. The model is saved for later deployment.

Streamlit Web Application: A simple, interactive web interface where users can input various parameters and get instant salary predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: For machine learning model building (Random Forest) and preprocessing.

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

Streamlit: For deploying the interactive web application.

Google Colab: Instructions for running the project in a Colab environment.
